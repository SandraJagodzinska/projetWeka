Bejeweled
.

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice!

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh?), have you heard? (Huh?)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (I miss you), but I miss sparkling (ah, hey)

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice!

Sapphire tears on my face, sadness became my whole sky (sky)
But some guy said my aura's moonstone just 'cause he was high
I been dancin' all night, and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice

I been dancin' all night, and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
