I Knew You Were Trouble
.

Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone

You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back

Without me
Without me
Without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why

You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be

And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (I'd never been)
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
