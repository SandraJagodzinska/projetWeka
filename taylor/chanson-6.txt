All Of The Girls You Loved Before
.

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the morning with someone
But feeling alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneaking out into town
Holding hands, just killing time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you the way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (ooh)
Crying in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (ooh)
We're breaking up, making up
Leave without saying goodbye (ooh)

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you baby
That's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels

And the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (dead-end street) led you straight to me (straight to me)
Now you're all I need (all I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

(I love you more)
(I love you more)
