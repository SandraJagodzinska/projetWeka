Now and Then
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
