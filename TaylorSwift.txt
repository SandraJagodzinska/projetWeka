cardigan
.

Vintage tee, brand-new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


Style
.

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat

I say: I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
(Some other girl)

He says: What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking about you, and I
I said: I've been there too, a few times

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh, oh, oh
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time (and when we go)
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style


Anti-Hero
.

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
Lightly disguised as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all of its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out
She's laughing up at us from hell

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero


Enchanted
.

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was
Enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered: Have we met?
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like
Passing notes in secrecy

And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door, I'd
Open up and you would say

Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that

This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (oh)

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you


Blank Space
.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh, my God, look at that face!
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh, my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


All Of The Girls You Loved Before
.

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the morning with someone
But feeling alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneaking out into town
Holding hands, just killing time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you the way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (ooh)
Crying in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (ooh)
We're breaking up, making up
Leave without saying goodbye (ooh)

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you baby
That's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels

And the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (dead-end street) led you straight to me (straight to me)
Now you're all I need (all I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

(I love you more)
(I love you more)


Cruel Summer
.

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up, grinning like a devil

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed for whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


You're Not Sorry
.

All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down

And it's taken me this long, baby
But I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold

And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, no
No, no, no, no, no


High Infidelity
.

Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Storm coming, good husband, bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough
It's never enough

Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count


Lover
.

We could leave the Christmas lights up till January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you, please, stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close, forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover


All Too Well (10 Minute Version)
.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck The Patriarchy keychain on the ground
We were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down: Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing, it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well
But I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened: You
That's what happened: You

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
Willin' you to come
And he said: It's supposed to be fun
Turning 21

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us (just between us)m I remember it all too well (wind in my hair)
(I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)


Daylight
.

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now, I see daylight
I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke

Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now, I'm wide awake)
And now, I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (in my mind)
All of you, all of me (intertwined)
I once believed love would be (black and white)
But it's golden (golden)
And I can still see it all (in my head)
Back and forth from New York (sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now, I'm wide awake)
And now, I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (ah)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (aah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (and I can still see it all)
(Back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night, I
I just think that
You are what you love


Karma
.

You're talkin’ shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you’re relevant
You’re terrified to look down
‘Cause if you dare, you’ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It’s coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn’t know what I mean

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a Goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spidеr-boy, king of thieves
Weavе your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don’t you know that cash ain’t the only price?
It’s coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn’t know what I mean

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a Goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here (I'm still here)

‘Cause karma is the thunder, rattling your ground
Karma’s on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma’s gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Comin’ straight home to me

‘Cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a Goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend, karma is a God
Karma’s a relaxing thought


Shake It Off
.

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, hm, hm
That's what people say, hm, hm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, hm, hm
That's what people say, hm, hm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break (break, break, break, break)
And the fakers gonna fake (fake, fake, fake, fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)

I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, hm, hm
That's what they don't see, hm, hm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, hm, hm

And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)

Heartbreakers gonna break (break, break, break, break)
And the fakers gonna fake (fake, fake, fake, fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)

Hey, hey, hey!
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
And she's like: Oh my God
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh!

'Cause the players gonna play (play, play, play, play)
And the haters gonna hate (hate, hate, hate, hate) (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake (shake, shake, shake, shake)

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off


The Great War
.

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground

And maybe it was ego swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the letter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire

And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from a crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were close and
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back

To that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vow I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

I'll always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War

Uh-huh

I vow I will always be yours


august
.

Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of: Are you sure?
Never have I ever before

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the Sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say: Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, oh

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?

Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall

(Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car)
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(Meet me behind the mall)

Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)


You're On Your Own, Kid
.

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I searched the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape, so long, Daisy Mae
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I searched the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss

The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away

'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been


Don't Blame Me
.

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say: She's gone too far this time

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're touching me
You're touching me
Every time you're, every time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life, oh)

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (oh)

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing, doing it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high (oh)
Every time you're, every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life


Bejeweled
.

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice!

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh?), have you heard? (Huh?)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (I miss you), but I miss sparkling (ah, hey)

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice!

Sapphire tears on my face, sadness became my whole sky (sky)
But some guy said my aura's moonstone just 'cause he was high
I been dancin' all night, and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
And when I meet the band, they ask: Do you have a man?
I can still say: I don't remember
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice

I been dancin' all night, and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice

Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer


​the 1
.

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know, the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I had this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know, the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)


champagne problems
.

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Perignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke: Well, it's made for me
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
Till someone's on their knees and asks you
She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head, they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems


Midnight Rain
.

(Rain)
(He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain)
(He wanted a bride, I was making my own name)
(Chasing that fame, he stayed the same)
(All of me changed like midnight)

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise

My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight 

(Rain)
(He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain)
(He wanted a bride, I was making my own name)
(Chasing that fame, he stayed the same)
(All of me changed like midnight)

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day

So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

(Rain)
(He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain)
(He wanted a bride, I was making my own name)
(Chasing that fame, he stayed the same)
(All of me changed like midnight)

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV

I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)


exile (feat. Bon Iver)
.

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all

And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me

Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time (So many signs)
I never learned to read your mind (So many signs)
I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

Wildest Dreams
.

He said: Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought: Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

I said: No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in the room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah (aah)
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down (down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around (follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again 
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah (aah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah


We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
.

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (what?)

Then you come around again and say: Baby
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Like, ever!

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say: Never say never

Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever! 
No

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together


The Way I Loved You
.

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says: You look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space and never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother and talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing, and I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

Oh, and that's the way I loved you
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Love Story
.

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say: Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said: Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you: Please, don't go

And I said: Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, uh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said: Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you: Please, don't go

And I said: Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said: Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said: Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you


You Belong With Me
.

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walking in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry

I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me


Getaway Car
.

(No, nothing good starts in a getaway car)

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh!)

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (oh, whoa)
No, they never get far (oh, whoa)
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well, he was running after us, I was screaming: Go, go, go!
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain’t a love story
And now we're both sorry
(We're both sorry)

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (oh!)

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (oh, whoa)
No, they never get far (oh, whoa)
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us, traitors, never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (oh!)

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (oh, whoa)
No, they never get far (oh, whoa)
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car


​mirrorball
.

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tip-toes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tip-toes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tip-toes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tip-toes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight


All Too Well
.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the Tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralysed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


​my tears ricochet
.

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


Paper Rings
.

The Moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month, or two, or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once, 'cause you know I had a long night (oh)
Kiss me twice, 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
Three times, 'cause I've waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And paper rings, and picture frames, and dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once, 'cause I know you had a long night (oh)
Kiss you twice, 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
Three times, 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And paper rings, and picture frames, and dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh, huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh, huh, that's right
You're the one I want
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah, ah, darling, you're the one I want

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh, huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
And paper rings, and picture frames, and all my dreams
You're the one I want
Paper rings, and picture frames, and all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want


Delicate
.

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

('Cause I like you)
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

('Cause I like you)
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Sometimes, I wonder: When you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time

('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Delicate)

('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it, isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Isn't it delicate?)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it, isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?


Afterglow
.

I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry till it blows up, till there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face
And I'm to blame, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say: Hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you in silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face
Don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say: Hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say: Hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow


Look What You Made Me Do
.

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you

I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)

I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why?
Oh, 'cause she's dead! (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


Wonderland
.

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us: Don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ay, ay)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better (ay, ay)

(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us: Don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire Cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'till somebody loses their mind
But, darling

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ay, ay)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better (ay, ay)

(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
In Wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad, oohh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever) (ay, ay)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse, but never better (never better) (ay, ay)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
(In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better
In Wonderland


The Archer
.

Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?

Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes died all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming: Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Combat, I'm ready for combat


Hits Different
.

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street

Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walking on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time

Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you
('Cause it's you)

I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the Sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings

And I never don't cry (no, I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (my sadness is contagious)
I slur your name till someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time

Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you
('Cause it's you)

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleeding?

You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy

Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical, dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
(To take me away)

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (it hits different)
It hits different this time

Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (it hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

(Oh my, love is a lie)
(Shit my friends say to get me by)
('Cause it's you)
(Catastrophic blues)
(Moving on was always easy for me to do)
It hits different (yeah)
It hits different 'cause it's you


Question...?
.

(I remember)

Good girl, sad boy, big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something, 'cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights a color I've searched for since

But one thing after another fucking situation
Circumstances, miscommunications
And I have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (you)
But fifteen seconds latеr they were clapping, too?
Thеn, what did you do?

Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? (Oh)
Did you wish you put up more of a fight? (Oh)
When she said it was too much, do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Half-Moon eyes, bad surprise, did you realize?
Out of time, she was on your mind
With some dickhead guy that you saw that night
But you were on something

It was one drink after another, fucking politics and gender-roles
And you're not sure, and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray 
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping, too?
Then, what did you do?

Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? (Oh)
Did you wish you put up more of a fight? (Oh)
When she said it was too much, do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Does it feel like everything's just like second-best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight

Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping, too?
Then what did you do? (Do)

Did you leave her house in the middle of night? (Oh)
Did you wish you put up more of a fight? (Oh, more of a fight)
When she said it was too much, do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Call It What You Want
.

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright

All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm

All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right

I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I

I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)

(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to


​this is me trying
.

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least I'm trying


Would've, Could've, Should've
.

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance

And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven

And now that I'm grown
I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this

And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Oh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven

And now that I'm grown
I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time

I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first

And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven

And now that I'm grown
I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time

I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Oh, God, rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time

I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


Mastermind
.

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me?
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see, all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body?
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This the first time I felt the need to confess
And I swear, I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then, saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time

You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind


gold rush
.

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking
Ships on waters
So inviting
I almost jump in

I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominos
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered 'round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominos
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
Won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea
'Cause it will never be

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking
Ships on waters
So inviting
I almost jump in


​peace
.

Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?


22
.

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Ah, ah, ah, ah (who's TS anyway? Ew)

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh
Eh, eh, eh, yeah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're (dance like we're twenty-two)

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Dancing like)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you


Vigilante Shit
.

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill, and I might try

I don't dress for women, I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressing for revenge
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends, I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressing for revenge

She needed a cold heart proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where'd you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me, thick as thieves with your ex-wife

And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends, she don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet, and kind, and fun
The lady simply had enough

Well, he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents 
I'm on the vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends, I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressing for revenge


Red
.

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colours in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (red, red, red, red)
Loving him was red (red, red, red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you'd never found out
That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (red, red)
Oh, red (red, red)
Burning red (red, red, red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (red, red)
Oh, burning red (red, red, red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me burning red (red, red)
Yeah, yeah (red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead end street


invisible string
.

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)


Maroon
.

When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend

How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?
You say: Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was

The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?

You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon

The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was (maroon)

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (it was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon


willow
.

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would have known from the look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneakin' in
As if you are a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


betty
.

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself?
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you
When she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said: James, get in, let's drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you


Sweet Nothing
.

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly, a pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?

Ooh, ooh

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to something
I found myself running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say: What a mind
This happens all the time

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to something
I found myself running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out-glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, you should be doing more
To you I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to something
I found myself running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

They said the end is comin' (they said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to something (everyone's up to something)
I found myself running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving (outside they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming (you're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing


Long Live
.

I said: Remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming: Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said: Remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there, on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming: This is absurd
'Cause, for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming: Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming: Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name

Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming: Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing: Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


Cornelia Street
.

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (yeah)

I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car


ME! (feat. Brendon Urie)
.

I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And then we had that fight out in the rain
You went after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no I in team
But you know there is a me
Strike the band up, one, two, three
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in team
But you know there is a me
And you can't spell awesome without me
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e (yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (and I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you (oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no I in team (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a me
I'm the only one of me (oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me (eeh-eeh-eeh)
Strike the band up, one, two, three (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can't spell awesome without me
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


tolerate it
.

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn 
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you


seven
.

Please, picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please, picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long


Back To December
.

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around
And make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came with the dark days
When the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around
And make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time


...Ready For It?
.

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor (hey!)
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure (hey)
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gon' go (go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (low)
No one has to know
(No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Ooh
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (in my dreams)
You should see the things we do,(we do) baby,(baby) hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

In the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?


Gorgeous
.

(Gorgeous)

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing I don't know what
You're so cool it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
(But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room
(Dark room, dark room)

If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (ugh)
Alone
Unless you wanna come along?

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (what I can't have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous


​illicit affairs
.

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times


I Knew You Were Trouble
.

Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone

You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back

Without me
Without me
Without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why

You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be

And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (I'd never been)
'Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble


Mr. Perfectly Fine
.

Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waiting for you all my life
Mr. Every single day until the end, I will be by your side

But that was when I got to know Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone, I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye

Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy

He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm around a brand new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

How's your heart after breaking mine?

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel

So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too Late

Goodbye, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

You're perfectly fine

Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said you'd never go away


Snow On The Beach (feat. Lana Del Rey)
.

One night, a few Moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me

Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched: Aurora borealis green
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery

My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do, till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

I (I) can't (can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?

Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream (flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (you wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)
Like snow, ah
It's coming down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)


The Man
.

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars and getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars, I'd be a bitch not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (oh)
I'd be the man (yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man


Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince
.

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway: She's a bad, bad girl (okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway: She's a bad, bad girl (okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I just think you should know
And I'll never let you (go) 'cause I know this is a (fight)
That someday we're gonna (win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway: She's a bad, bad girl
Oh, I just thought you should know (you should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (go) 'cause I know this is a (fight)
That one day we're gonna (win), I just think you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway: She's a bad, bad girl
She's a bad, bad girl


Bad Blood (feat. Kendrick Lamar)
.

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was on D like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more
Better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey


Fearless
.

There's something about the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby, drive slow
Till we run out of road
In this one-horse town
I want to stay right here
In this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way, but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless


End Game (feat. Ed Sheeran & Future)
.

[TS & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation (git, git)
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, You like the bad ones, too (yeah)

[Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life (my life)

[TS & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[.]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee-deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[TS & Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you, I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[TS & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Aah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (hey!)
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Aah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[TS]
I hit you like bang! We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[TS, Future & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you) (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now) (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do!) (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game


right where you left me
.

Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me

Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say: What a sad sight

I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me

You left me no
Oh, you left me no
You left me no choice, but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no
Oh, you left me no
You left me no choice, but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be

Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

At the restaurant
When I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light
Everything was just right

I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say: What a sad sight

I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where

I cause no harm
Mind my business, if our love died young
I can't bear witness, and it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
I'm right where you left me

You left me no
Oh, you left me no
You left me no choice, but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no
Oh, you left me no
You left me no choice, but to stay here forever


Better Than Revenge
.

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Time for a little revenge!

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
But she's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find, stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
But she's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find, stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

C'mon, can't take that? C'mon

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
But she's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find, stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
Oh, do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say sabotage!


Dress
.

Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience
Pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah-ah-ah
All of this silence and patience
Pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this, ah-ah-ah-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-o-off
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-o-off

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about

All of this silence and patience
Pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah-ah-ah
All of this silence and patience
Pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this, ah-ah-ah-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-o-off
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-off

Ah, ah, ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ah, ah, ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me

And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this, ah-ah-ah-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-o-off
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it o-o-o-off

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off


happiness
.

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up

Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things I believe
There is happiness in our history

Across a great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I pay for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine every goddamn night
Now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow
Where you used to lay your head

After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
But I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness in our history

Across a great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight
Leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness


New Romantics
.

We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom (ah, ah, ah)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumours
Are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true (ah, ah, ah)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free (ah, ah, ah)

So come on, come along with me (ah, ah, ah)
The best people in life are free

Please, take my hand, and
Please, take me dancing
And, please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could built a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


Labyrinth
.

It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life

You know how scared I am of elevators, never trusted it
If it rises fast, it can't last

Oh, oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Oh, oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Oh, oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Oh, oh, I'm falling in love
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Oh, oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh, no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

You know how much I hate it
You know how much I hate it
You know how much I hate it


evermore (feat. Bon Iver)
.

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for evermore

Hey, December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On the vеry moment, all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for evermore
(Evermore)

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether, weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)

If you think of all the costs (it was real enough)
Whether weather be the frost (to get me through)
Or the violence of the dog days (or the violence of the dog days)
Out on the waves being tossed (out on the waves being tossed) (I swear)
Is there a line that we could just go cross? (You were there)

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking
Under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore (evermore)
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore (ooh)
Evermore


I Did Something Bad
.

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh, so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says: Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change, then he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

They say I did something bad (oh)
Then why's it feel so good? (So good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good? (Good)
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (good), good

Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad)
But why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good


Out Of The Woods
.

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (oh) are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the Sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said: I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the Sun came up, you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me (are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?) I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good) oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah, yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (yeah) are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good (clear yet? Good)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good (do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good


Begin Again
.

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
'Cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café
I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
'Cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café
I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
'Cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café
I watched it begin again

On a Wednesday, in a café
I watched it begin again


Death By a Thousand Cuts
.

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye
Is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes
And you're not my baby

I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend
It's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights
If it'll be alright
They say: I don't know

And what once was ours
Is no one's now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
Is this small town

You said it was a great love
One for the ages
But if the story's over
Why am I still writing pages?

'Cause saying goodbye
Is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it’s not enough
'Cause the morning comes
And you're not my baby

I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend
It's okay when it's not
It’s death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me
That you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs
In a haunted club

Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans

My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright
It's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend
It's okay when it's not

No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
(You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me
That you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust
(It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough
It wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights
If it'll be alright
They say: I don't know


‘tis the damn season
.

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me Babe for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you
It's okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me Babe for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me, if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own

To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leavin'
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

We could call it even
You could call me Babe for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

It always leads to you and my hometown


Dear John
.

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up
And this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you, and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret
How I ignored when they said: Run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town, ooh

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known


marjorie
.

Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs

I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around


dorothea
.

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger, down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery

You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oh, this place is the same as it ever was
Oh, but you won't like it that way

It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know, that you'll always know me, Dorothea (uh, uh)
Dorothea (ah, ah)

Oh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' make up in magazines
Oh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers?
Well

Oh, I guess I'll never know
Oh, and you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (uh, uh)
Dorothea (ah, ah)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (ah, ah, ah)
Ah, ah


Cold As You
.

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me

So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away

And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
Died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


I Bet You Think About Me (feat. Chris Stapleton)
.

3 AM, and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin': Why did you let her go?
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered, 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch

I bet you think about me when you say:
Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me


A Place In This World
.

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down

Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?

And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl


I Don’t Wanna Live Forever (feat. ZAYN)
.

Been sitting, eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something
Oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I'm sitting, eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, ooh

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something
But you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Baby, baby, I feel crazy)
I see you around in all these empty faces
(Up all night, all night and every day)

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Give me something, oh, but you say nothing)
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
(What is happening to me?)

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
Until you come back home


hoax
.

My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed Sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside screaming: Give me a reason
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside screaming: Give me a reason
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do


Last Kiss
.

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July 9th, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on calling me baby like trying on clothes

Salute to me, I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, woah

And all at once
I've been waiting, waiting
Woah, woah
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, woah
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me, I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room (inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, woah (my heart)

And all at once (hey)
I've been waiting, waiting (waiting)
Woah, woah
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting, waiting (waiting, waiting)
Body and soul, woah
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, woah (my heart, my soul)

And all at once
I've been waiting, waiting
Woah, woah
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, woah
And all at once


Bigger Than The Whole Sky
.

No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet

What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet

What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

(What could've been, would've been)
(What could've been, would've been)
(What could've been, would've been)
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

(What could've been, would've been)
What could've been, would've been you
(What could've been, would've been)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet

What could've been, would've been
What should've been you


Clean
.

The drought was the very worst, ah, ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together
Died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah, ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress
I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah, ah
When the butterflies turned to dust
That covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah, ah
Let the flood carry away
All my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed
So loud, but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean, ahh
Said, I think I am finally clean, ahh

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah, ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together
Died of thirst

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah, ah
Think I'm finally clean


coney island (feat. The National)
.

Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?

And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the Sun goes down

The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement?
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me

And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the Sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock?
Did I leave you hanging every single day?

Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake? Happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?

A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the Sun goes down

When the Sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the Sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name

Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold


Paris
.

Your ex friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003, unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways, cheap wine
Make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else (where else)

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitated thought, all the messes made
Sip wine by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways, cheap wine
Make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else (Paris)

I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping sloping cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights
Be the tower at midnight

In my mind
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne

'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else


Speak Now
.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said: Speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song
That sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said: Speak now

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is runnin' out
And they said: Speak now

I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
There's a silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands
All eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said: Speak now

And you say: Let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vow
So glad you were around
When they said: Speak now


Dear Reader
.

Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run

Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)

Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries
Is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man

Spilling out to you for free
But, darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking

If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

(You should find another guiding light, guiding light)
(Well, I shine so bright)
(You should find another guiding light, guiding light)
(But I shine so bright)

(You should find another)
(You should find another) (guiding light)
(Find another)
(You should find another)

(You should find another)


the last great american dynasty
.

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said: How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said

There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said

There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time


cowboy like me
.

And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said: Dancing is a dangerous game
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
Never wanted love, just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one

You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it

You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it

You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again


Fifteen
.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in, this is life
Before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date, and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mama's waiting up, and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes you head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

At your very first day
Oh, take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors


the lakes
.

Is it romantic how all my elegies
Eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes
Where all the poets went to die
I don't belong
And, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks
Look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off
But not without my muse

What should be over
Burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes
Where all the poets went to die
I don't belong
And, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks
Look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off
But not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow
Right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here

A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes
Where all the poets went to die
I don't belong
And, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks
Look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off
But not without my muse
No, not without you


Mine
.

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say: Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember, all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
And I ran out crying
And you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said: I'll never leave you alone

You said: I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you is like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

(Hold on, make it last)
(Hold on, never turn back)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on, hold on)

Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (hold on)
And I can see it
(Yeah, yeah, I can see it now, see it now)
