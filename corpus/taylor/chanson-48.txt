It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Ah, ah, ah, ah (who's TS anyway? Ew)

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh, oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh
Eh, eh, eh, yeah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're (dance like we're twenty-two)

Twenty-two, ooh, ooh
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Dancing like)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh)
Twenty-two, ooh, ooh, ooh

(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
