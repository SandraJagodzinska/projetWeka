evermore (feat. Bon Iver)
.

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for evermore

Hey, December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On the vеry moment, all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for evermore
(Evermore)

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether, weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)

If you think of all the costs (it was real enough)
Whether weather be the frost (to get me through)
Or the violence of the dog days (or the violence of the dog days)
Out on the waves being tossed (out on the waves being tossed) (I swear)
Is there a line that we could just go cross? (You were there)

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking
Under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore (evermore)
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore (ooh)
Evermore
