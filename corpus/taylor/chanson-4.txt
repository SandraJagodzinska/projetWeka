Enchanted
.

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was
Enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered: Have we met?
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like
Passing notes in secrecy

And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door, I'd
Open up and you would say

Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was
Enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that

This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (oh)

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
