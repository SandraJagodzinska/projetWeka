We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
.

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (what?)

Then you come around again and say: Baby
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Like, ever!

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say: Never say never

Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever! 
No

We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
