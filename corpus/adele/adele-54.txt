Wild Wild West
I grew a nipper in the wild, wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild, wild west
I was galivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow catching in the wilderness
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya
From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego
I'm cuttin' shines in the wild, wild west
I had to bed my man down to save myself
That's when I, I got churched in the, in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
(I'll shoot you down)
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya
From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego
Wild in the west (it's so wild)
It's so wild in the west
(It's so wild, it's so wild)
(It's so wild in the west)
Wild, wild west
From L.A. to San Francisco
Lost my mind in (I lost my mind) San Bernardino
(In Chula) Chula Vista and Modesto
Broke my heart (broke my heart) in San Diego
From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go
